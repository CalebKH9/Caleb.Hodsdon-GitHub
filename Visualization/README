Included are three graphs showing servers in a restaraunts average revenue per customer. 
I have removed the name of the servers and changed the data from the actual data set taken from a restaruant.
Seeing the average revenue each server has per customer is a good way for the buisness to evaluate which servers are maximizing profits for the restaurant and can help make scheduling decisions.
All ploting and processing of data was done in R
